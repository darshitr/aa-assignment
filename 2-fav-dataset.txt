I recently discoverd UR-FUNNY data set which is a multimodal language data set
for understanding humor. It contains 5,000 videos of humorous punchlines, with
an equal number of negative samples. The videos are annotated with language,
visual, and acoustic features, as well as humor labels. The data set was created
by researchers from the University of Rochester and Carnegie Mellon University.
The data set can be used to train and evaluate models for humor detection,
which is a challenging task in natural language processing. The data set is
publicly available on Github.
